Tools for constructing subspace and calculating magnitude between them.

Anyone can easily construct subspace from the data, and calculate magnitude between constructed subspaces!

This code is written based on the two papers, [Difference Subspace and Its Generalization for Subspace-Based Methods](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7053916) and [Second-order difference subspace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08563).
